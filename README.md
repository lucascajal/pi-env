# pi-env

[Pi](https://pi.dev/) extension that sets process environment variables from `settings.json` at startup.

Declare env vars declaratively in your pi settings instead of using shell wrappers or polluting your global shell environment.

**Why?**

- **Scoped to pi only** — variables are set inside the pi process without affecting your terminal session or other tools
- **Override existing vars** — set pi-specific values that take precedence over what's already in your shell (e.g. route a provider through a different endpoint without changing your global AWS config)
- **Declarative and portable** — commit project-level env config in `.pi/settings.json` for your team, keep personal values in global settings

## Installation

```bash
pi install npm:pi-env
```

Or from git:

```bash
pi install https://github.com/ksjf977/pi-env
```

## Usage

Add an `"env"` key to your global or project settings:

**`~/.pi/agent/settings.json`** (global) or **`.pi/settings.json`** (project):

```json
{
  "env": {
    "AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME": "https://my.corp.proxy/bedrock",
    "AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK": "$MY_CORP_TOKEN",
    "AWS_BEDROCK_FORCE_HTTP1": "1",
    "GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT": "my-project",
    "GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION": "us-central1"
  }
}
```

Environment variables are set before providers initialize, so they're available when pi makes API requests.

## Variable interpolation

Reference pre-existing environment variables using pi's value resolution syntax:

| Syntax | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `$ENV_VAR` | Value of `ENV_VAR` from the shell environment |
| `${ENV_VAR}` | Same, braced form (useful when followed by text) |
| `$$` | Literal `$` character |
| `literal` | Used as-is |

```json
{
  "env": {
    "API_URL": "https://${REGION}.api.example.com/v1",
    "AUTH_TOKEN": "$VAULT_TOKEN",
    "PRICE": "$$9.99"
  }
}
```

## Settings hierarchy

Honors pi's settings merge behavior:

1. **Global** (`~/.pi/agent/settings.json`) — base defaults
2. **Project** (`.pi/settings.json`) — overrides global per-key

If both define `env`, the project values override global values for the same keys. Unique keys from both levels are merged.

## Features

- **Scalar coercion** — numbers and booleans are coerced to strings via `String()`
- **Stale cleanup** — variables removed from settings are unset on `/reload`
- **`/env` command** — print currently configured env vars in the TUI at any time
- **Styled output** — shows a summary of applied variables on session start
- **Warnings** — notifies in the TUI for unresolved variables, non-scalar values, or overridden existing env vars

## Why not just export in .zshrc?

Shell exports apply to every process. With `pi-env`, you can:

- Set `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_BEDROCK_RUNTIME` for pi without affecting your AWS CLI
- Override `AWS_REGION` per-project without changing your shell profile
- Keep provider routing config versioned with the project
- Avoid wrapper functions like `pi() { VAR=x command pi "$@"; }`
